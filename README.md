# Neovim Configuration

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This configuration is still a work in progress. Not all settings, plugins, and features are fully implemented. Check back for updates as I continue to build out this configuration.

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, tailored for an efficient development workflow with plugins managed by [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`init.lua`**: The main configuration file for Neovim.
- **`lua/`**: Contains Lua configuration files for plugins, settings, and custom scripts.
- **`after/`**: Post-configuration tweaks and additional settings.

## üîå Plugins

This configuration includes a carefully selected set of plugins to enhance productivity. With **Lazy.nvim**, plugins are loaded only when needed for faster startup times.

Some core plugins:

- **[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)**: Fuzzy finder for files, buffers, and more.
- **[Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)**: Enhanced syntax highlighting and code understanding.
- **[LSP Config](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)**: Language Server Protocol configuration.
- **[Nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp)**: Autocompletion framework.
- **[Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)**: Plugin manager for lazy loading.

*Replace with the plugins you're using in your configuration.*
